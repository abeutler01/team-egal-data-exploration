2209,i think you'll love the food.,10
2210,you have pretty eyes.,8
2211,thank you. so do you.,54
2212,i wish my eyes were blue.,10
2213,what's the matter with green eyes?,7
2214,"nothing, except my favorite color is blue.",4
2215,maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes.,34
2216,but what if i'm a fish in my next life?,38
2217,i think some fish have blue eyes.,0
2218,i hope i don't come back as a fish.,16
2219,i hope i come back as a cat.,16
2220,cats have beautiful eyes.,44
2221,i love you.,10
2222,"i love you, too.",9
2223,i loved you the first day i saw you.,50
2224,it was love at first sight?,1
2225,"yes, it was love at first sight.",4
2226,i didn't love you at first.,0
2227,i know. i had to chase you for a while.,16
2228,"yes, you chased me and then you caught me.",56
2229,now you're mine forever.,6
2230,and you're mine forever.,8
2231,we'll grow old together.,6
2232,i'm in love with that girl.,0
2233,have you told her?,1
2234,of course not.,6
2235,why not?,2
2236,she would laugh at me.,16
2237,how do you know?,2
2238,because they always do.,44
2239,maybe she's different.,8
2240,they're all the same.,34
2241,just ask her out to dinner.,8
2242,and then what?,7
2243,give me a hug.,0
2244,i'm not in the mood.,10

2249,i was not looking at her.,0
2250,"you were, too.",12
2251,i'm not interested in her.,10
2252,then why were you looking at her?,1
2253,i was looking at something else.,0
2254,would you like to go on a blind date?,7
2255,you must be joking.,6
2256,"no, i'm serious.",9
2257,i don't want to date a blind woman.,31
2258,a blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!,32
2259,what does it mean?,7
2260,a blind date is a date with someone you don't know.,52
2261,why would i date someone i don't even know?,24
2262,to try something new and exciting.,8
2263,what if i don't like her?,24
2264,i have a date tomorrow night.,35
2265,really? who with?,33
2266,a girl i met at the market.,35
2267,you met a girl at the supermarket?,51
2268,she was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.,31
2269,what did you say to her?,7
2270,"i had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where i had found them.",11
2271,she asked you about your pineapples?,51
2272,"i told her i had gotten the last two on the shelf, but i offered her one of mine.",28
2273,that was nice of you.,8
2274,"she asked me how she could return the favor, so i asked her out.",56
2275,did you have a date friday night?,13
2276,"yes, in fact, i did.",19
2277,who did you go out with?,2
2278,a man i met in a coffee shop.,35
2279,where did you go?,2
2280,we went to a nice restaurant.,44
2281,anywhere else?,1
2282,then we went to a jazz club.,34
2283,that sounds like a nice date.,44
2284,"yes, it was pleasant.",42
2285,but you won't date him again?,51
2286,i had the worst date the other night.,35
2287,what happened?,7
2288,"first of all, he was half an hour late.",47
2289,that's not a good start.,44
2290,then he didn't bother to apologize.,8
2291,that's rude.,8
2292,then he drove too fast to the restaurant.,44
2293,that's dangerous.,34
2294,i thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.,31
2295,what happened at the restaurant?,13
2296,"we had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!",32
2297,i don't like that man.,16
2298,why not?,2
2299,he's a dirty old man.,34
2300,what do you mean?,7
2301,"he's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.",48
2302,"well, you can't blame a man for asking.",47
2303,he should act his age.,34
2304,but a lot of old people are still interested in dating.,34
2305,they should find a nice hobby.,8
2306,just wait until you're 50 years old.,34
2307,dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.,8
2308,does your girlfriend ever make you angry?,7
2309,sometimes.,6
2310,what does she do?,1
2311,"just yesterday, i told her i wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.",56
2312,that was a nice thing to say.,44
2313,that's what i thought.,16
2314,what did she say?,7
2315,she laughed! she didn't believe me.,58
2316,that wasn't very nice of her.,8
2317,she said that nothing is more important to me than money.,31
2318,what did you say?,7
2319,some people have good noses.,8
2320,i wish i had a good nose. mine is way too big.,16
2321,i don't mean good-looking. i mean good-smelling.,58
2322,oh. but that can be a curse.,27
2323,"yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.",42
2324,i'll say. my girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.,31
2325,did she catch you using drugs?,1
2326,sort of. she knows whenever i sneak a cigarette.,16
2327,you don't need a good nose for thatÂ—cigarettes stink.,44
2328,"but when i sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!",59
2329,"boy, that is a good nose.",42
2330,let's go out to eat.,8
2331,that sounds like fun.,8
2332,where do you want to go?,1
2333,let me think a minute.,0
2334,i feel like chinese.,10
2335,that sounds delicious.,8
2336,i know a good chinese restaurant.,35
2337,how far away is it?,51
2338,it's only 10 minutes from here.,6
2339,do we need reservations?,1
2340,"oh, no. we can walk right in.",26
2341,i can't believe how long this line is.,0
2342,"this is a popular restaurant, isn't it?",25
2343,"yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it?",57
2344,it's the slowest hamburger in town.,8
2345,that's because they cook it while you wait.,44
2346,yes. that's why it's also the best hamburger in town.,27
2347,a great burger and great service.,52
2348,"yes, the workers are very polite.",12
2349,and they're clean.,34
2350,i've been coming here for years.,0
2351,me too.,10
2352,lunch was delicious.,6
2353,thank you.,8
2354,what kind of soup was that?,7
2355,it was tomato soup.,8
2356,that tasted so good.,34
2357,i put lemon and butter in it.,0
2358,"the sandwich was good, too.",4
2359,everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.,52
2360,especially on toast.,34
2361,"and the pickles were great, too.",42
2362,tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.,34
2363,i'm calling the waiter.,16
2364,what's the matter?,7
2365,this steak has too much fat.,44
2366,what do you want the waiter to do?,51
2367,bring me a better steak.,16
2368,i wouldn't do that.,0
2369,why not?,2
2370,"they will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it.",45
2371,you're crazy.,8
2372,then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.,52
2373,where do you get these crazy ideas?,7
2374,let's leave.,8
2375,but we just got here.,6
2376,did you see the waiter's hands?,7
2377,no.,6
2378,he had dirty fingernails.,34
2379,really?,1
2380,his nails were black!,32
2381,that's disgusting.,8
2382,and he poured water into our glasses.,44
2383,yuck! no water for me.,58
2384,"i wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too.",19
2385,this hot bread is delicious.,8
2386,i like this restaurant because they give you free bread.,31
2387,"well, i think we are paying for it.",19
2388,no. look at the bill when we get it. there's no charge for the bread.,8
2389,"it is delicious, especially with butter.",4
2390,i think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.,35
2391,they probably wouldn't like that.,34
2392,i'm eating so much bread that i'm getting full.,16
2393,then stop eating the bread!,32
2394,"okay, just one more piece. pass the butter, please.",42
2395,"if i owned a restaurant, i would never serve hot bread before the main course.",11
2396,is this a clean restaurant?,13
2397,"well, the tables and chairs look okay.",47
2398,"okay, let's sit down.",4
2399,check out the silverware.,8
2400,it passes inspection.,8
2401,here comes the waiter. see if his hands and nails are clean.,3
2402,"well, the waiter looked clean, so i guess it's okay to eat here.",11
2403,you're forgetting about the bathroom.,34
2404,i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.,35
2405,you're not going to examine it before we order dinner?,1
2406,"no, i'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because i'm pretty hungry right now.",48
2407,have you seen our waiter?,7
2408,here he comes now.,6
2409,we've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.,8
2410,"oops, i guess i was wrong. that isn't our waiter.",48
2411,"we can give him five more minutes, and then leave.",47
2412,i'll go up front and talk to the manager.,31
2413,that's a good idea.,44
2414,maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.,34
2415,maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.,44
2416,"every time we eat out, it's an adventure.",47
2417,"last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.",42
2418,is this table okay?,7
2419,"no, it's too close to the kitchen door.",12
2420,how about this table?,7
2421,"no, it's too close to the front door.",12
2422,this looks like a nice table.,34
2423,"no, it's too close to the salad bar.",47
2424,"okay, i give up.",19
2425,"well, there is one good table.",4
2426,great. which one?,14
2427,i don't believe the art world.,0
2428,what is it this time?,1
2429,an andy warhol drawing.,52
2430,he's a famous artist.,44
2431,he drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.,52
2432,did he sign it?,2
2433,yes.,6
2434,is it beautiful?,1
2435,it's just black ink on a white napkin. and the napkin has food stains!,52
2436,so it's not worth much?,2
2437,"only about $30,000.",4
2438,can we go to the baseball game?,13
2439,of course.,6
2440,i love baseball.,16
2441,so do i.,6
2442,i love to eat the peanuts.,16
2443,i love to eat the hot dogs.,0
2444,i hope we'll see a home run.,0
2445,i hope we'll catch a foul ball.,35
2446,bring a jacket.,34
2447,yes. it gets a little cool at night.,8
2448,bring a glove to catch a foul ball.,52
2449,golf is a silly game.,34
2450,it certainly is.,8
2451,you hit a white ball.,34
2452,and then you chase it.,34
2453,and then you hit it again.,44
2454,"finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.",47
2455,"you do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes.",4
2456,what's the point?,1
2457,how can it be fun?,1
2458,they pay money to play this silly game!,32
2459,i think golfers have a mental problem.,35
2460,do you want to go fishing?,1
2461,yes. that's a good idea.,27
2462,where do you want to go?,1
2463,we can go to the river.,8
2464,or we can go to the lake.,34
2465,or we can go to the ocean.,34
2466,let's go to the lake.,8
2467,yes. the lake is only 10 miles away.,27
2468,we can be there in 20 minutes.,8
2469,i'll get our fishing rods.,10
2470,i'll get the bait.,0
2471,baseball is fun.,34
2472,i like to hit the ball.,0
2473,i like to run around the bases.,16
2474,i like to slide into the bases.,0
2475,yeah. it's a lot of fun to slide.,8
2476,i want to be a baseball player when i grow up.,35
2477,me too. i want to play for the yankees.,16
2478,not me. i want to play for the dodgers.,0
2479,we have to practice every day.,44
2480,i don't like practice.,0
2481,me neither. it's boring.,41
2482,let's go jogging.,6
2483,that's a good idea.,44
2484,i bought some new shoes.,10
2485,are they comfortable?,1
2486,they're very comfortable.,8
2487,how much were they?,2
2488,they were on sale for $80.,37
2489,do they help you run faster?,1
2490,"no, but my feet don't hurt anymore.",4
2491,then they're worth every penny.,6
2492,you might want to buy a pair.,44
2493,tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.,8
2494,you can say that again.,52
2495,but i'm worried about tiger.,0
2496,why is that?,1
2497,because he likes to scuba dive.,34
2498,what's wrong with that?,7
2499,it can be dangerous.,34
2500,you mean he could drown.,8
2501,he shouldn't scuba dive until he retires.,8
2502,but he dives to relax.,8
2503,"he might relax, but it makes me nervous.",48
2504,did you watch that golf tournament?,51
2505,the one that tiger won?,1
2506,how did he do it?,2
2507,it was nothing for him.,6
2508,he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!,32
2509,he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.,52
2510,i think he is from outer space.,0
2511,no human could possibly play golf that well.,44
2512,"whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot.",47
2513,no human can do that.,44
2514,somebody should check his birth record.,6
2515,who's the greatest baseball player?,13
2516,there are so many great players.,44
2517,"yes, but who is the greatest?",36
2518,i'd have to say babe ruth.,35
2519,most people would say that.,34
2520,he changed the game.,34
2521,"yes, he made the home run popular.",42
2522,"everybody loved him, all over the nation.",42
2523,he helped make the yankees the best team ever.,44
2524,"and ruth was a good person, too.",42
2525,he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.,44
2526,did you hear what happened at the baseball game?,39
2527,"no, please tell me.",19
2528,someone punched out someone.,6
2529,that's not nice.,8
2530,it's worse than that.,44
2531,how so?,2
2532,two guys got into an argument.,34
2533,i'll bet they were drinking.,10
2534,a third guy punched one of the two guys.,8
2535,"i'll bet he was drinking, too.",9
2536,the victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.,34
2537,i want to go to the ball game.,35
2538,is there a game tonight?,7
2539,"yes, it starts at 7 p.m.",26
2540,can we get tickets?,1
2541,"yes, but only the cheap tickets.",4
2542,how much are they?,2
2543,they're only $5 each.,37
2544,that's a good price.,34
2545,"yes, it's cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.",47
2546,where are the seats?,1
2547,they're behind the outfield.,6
2548,golf is so hard.,8
2549,what's so hard about hitting a little white ball?,13
2550,it's hard if you want to do it right.,34
2551,you mean like tiger?,1
2552,"no, like a good amateur golfer.",47
2553,what's so hard about golf?,51
2554,there are so many things you have to do right.,34
2555,like what?,1
2556,"like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through.",42
2557,yikes! who can remember all that?,51
2558,you need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.,34
2559,did you hear about the ball player?,13
2560,the home run hitter on drugs?,2
2561,he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.,52
2562,he said he wasn't using drugs.,8
2563,he apologized to the fans.,34
2564,the league suspended him for 50 games.,34
2565,that will cost him some money.,8
2566,"yes, about $7 million.",4
2567,that will teach him a good lesson.,44
2568,he probably won't use drugs anymore.,34
2569,but it won't stop other players from using drugs.,8
2570,why is there so much crime?,2
2571,because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.,44
2572,is that it?,1
2573,"also, there aren't enough police.",4
2574,but there are a lot of police.,8
2575,there's only one police officer per 100 criminals.,8
2576,can't we hire more police?,1
2577,no. it costs too much money.,6
2578,doesn't crime cost more than police?,1
2579,"yes, it does.",12
2580,so it would be cheaper to hire more police?,1
2581,this is a great neighborhood.,34
2582,"yes, it is.",12
2583,people are friendly.,6
2584,"yes, they are.",12
2585,the streets and sidewalks are clean.,44
2586,"yes, they are.",12
2587,there's a real nice park nearby.,52
2588,"yes, there is.",12
2589,i feel safe here.,0
2590,there is no crime here.,6
2591,i wish i could move here.,10
2592,the house burned down.,6
2593,what happened?,7
2594,the man fell asleep.,44
2595,was he smoking?,2
2596,"yes, he was smoking a cigarette.",42
2597,did he die?,2
2598,"yes, he did. his cat died, too.",4
2599,that's too bad. what about his smoke alarm?,39
2600,the battery was dead.,34
2601,a good battery would have saved his life.,52
2602,"he had cigarettes, but no battery.",47
2603,they say he has started fifteen big fires.,44
2604,he's been in jail three times already.,44
2605,why did they ever let him out?,2
2606,it's the law. they can't keep him in jail forever.,27
2607,why not? everyone knows he's a firebug. he loves to start fires.,49
2608,i don't know. sometimes the law doesn't make sense.,30
2609,but his latest fire killed someone.,8
2610,this time they have charged him with murder.,34
2611,so maybe he'll go to jail forever?,7
2612,i sure hope so.,10
2613,someone should set him on fire.,6
2614,put your seatbelt on.,8
2615,why?,2
2616,because it will protect you in case of an accident.,52
2617,but it's uncomfortable.,8
2618,it's the law.,8
2619,it's so much trouble.,6
2620,it's common sense.,6
2621,it's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.,35
2622,hold your breath till we get there.,8
2623,"okay, my seatbelt is on.",42
2624,i'm glad you don't complain very much.,16
2625,what are you doing?,1
2626,i'm going to change the light bulb. it burnt out.,30
2627,what are you standing on?,7
2628,a couple of dictionaries and some textbooks.,44
2629,are you crazy?,1
2630,what's the matter?,7
2631,those books will slip and you'll fall.,34

2640,but it's real easy to slip on.,34
2641,especially on these slick floors.,8
2642,someone who slips could hurt their back.,8

2690,no one believes that the crime rate is going down.,34
2691,people who live in california are crazy.,44
2692,why is that?,1
2693,because of all the earthquakes and fires.,52
2694,but big earthquakes happen only once in a while.,52
2695,once in a while is once too many.,34

2741,"well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems.",45

3064,i'm on a new diet.,0
3065,what are you eating now?,7
3066,i switched from pasta to potatoes.,35
3067,why did you do that?,1
3068,pasta is processed food. potatoes are natural food.,3
3069,natural food has more vitamins.,52
3070,and it's just as easy to prepare.,52
3071,how do you prepare the potatoes?,7
3072,"i wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes.",11
3073,that's pretty simple.,8
3074,"then i add butter, salt, and pepper.",48
3075,my girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.,31
3076,why was that?,1
3077,i sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before i tasted it.,16
3078,what's the matter with that?,51
3079,her mom is a great cook.,34
3080,"so, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.",47
3081,it hurt her feelings.,6
3082,oh.,6
3083,"i apologized to her, but i could tell she was still upset.",28
3084,maybe you shouldn't eat there again.,52
3085,i'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.,35
3086,i eat the same thing every day.,35
3087,you're kidding.,6
3088,"no, i'm serious.",9
3089,doesn't that get old?,1
3090,"no, because i'm eating food that i like.",56
3091,but the same thing day after day gets old.,52

3093,do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?,13
3094,"no, i hate vegetables.",48

3109,"me, too. i love them roasted and salted.",48
3110,i love boiled peanuts.,0
3111,boiled? i never heard of that.,23
3112,just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.,52
3113,i'll have to try them sometime.,0
3114,they're best when they're hot.,6
3115,my brother is allergic to peanuts.,34
3116,that's not good.,8
3117,"no, it isn't. he almost died when he was little.",4
3118,i guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.,31
3119,i'm gaining weight.,0
3120,how much have you gained?,7
3121,three pounds just this month.,6
3122,do you know why?,2

3130,i'm stuffed.,10
3131,of course you are. you ate everything on the table.,8
3132,i don't like to eat leftovers.,0
3133,i'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.,35
3134,i like my food hot and fresh.,0
3135,you like to see it disappear.,34
3136,i don't like it reheated.,0
3137,"well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night.",4
3138,i'm so full i'm going to burst.,10
3139,you should loosen your belt.,6
3140,i already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.,31
3141,i saw what you did.,0
3142,i didn't do anything.,0
3143,"oh yes, you did.",12
3144,what are you talking about?,51
3145,you know what i'm talking about.,35
3146,i don't have any idea.,35
3147,you know what you did.,8
3148,"maybe i know, but how could you know?",46

3158,"oh, look. here's another shirt just like it.",4
3159,does it have a price tag?,51
3160,"yes, it does. it's only $20.",15
3161,that's a great price.,44
3162,i think i'll buy both of them.,10
3163,i bought you a pair of pants.,35
3164,thank you.,8
3165,i hope they fit.,10
3166,i hope you kept the receipt.,10
3167,you think they won't fit?,2
3168,i think i've put on some weight.,10
3169,you think?,2
3170,maybe a pound or two.,34
3171,maybe four or five pounds?,1
3172,my waist is bigger than it was.,34
3173,no problem. these pants have an elastic waistband.,44

3188,what's wrong with them so soon?,1
3189,"the pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.",47
3190,you shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.,34
3191,but that's what pockets are for.,34
3192,you should carry them in a purse.,34
3193,"i'm a man, and men don't carry purses!",59
3194,"well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.",4
3195,i would if i could find someone who makes strong pockets.,50

3212,"well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.",42

3214,and a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.,37
3215,another good deal.,34
3216,but the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.,34
3217,i don't know how that store makes money.,16

3219,what's the matter with yours?,7

3257,"yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.",42
3258,just put them in the fridge.,6
3259,"also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.",59
3260,why did you do that?,1
3261,i mixed them together.,10
3262,i really like this house.,0
3263,can we afford it?,7
3264,they want 20 percent down.,8

3285,i don't like it.,10
3286,what's the matter with it?,7
3287,it's on the corner.,6
3288,so?,2
3289,that means it gets twice as much traffic.,52
3290,you're right.,6
3291,"when you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.",52
3292,or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.,8
3293,or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.,8
3294,let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.,52
3295,i hate looking for an apartment.,31
3296,"me, too.",9
3297,we have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on main street.,52
3298,we'd better get ready to go.,8
3299,it's an upstairs unit.,34
3300,"that's good, because i don't want to live under people with loud feet.",11
3301,and it's a corner unit.,34
3302,that's great. we won't have neighbors on both sides of us.,27
3303,no pets are allowed.,8
3304,perfect. we don't have to listen to barking dogs.,8
3305,and there are only six units in the whole building.,8

3307,yes. he said he'd come over tomorrow.,54
3308,did he say what time?,7

3310,did he understand what the problem is?,7
3311,yes. i told him our doorbell doesn't work.,41
3312,it shouldn't take him long to fix it.,8
3313,i don't even know why we need to fix it.,10
3314,in case we have visitors.,34
3315,but they can just knock on the door.,8
3316,"actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too.",11
3317,do you like this house?,2
3318,"yes, it's beautiful.",4
3319,it's perfect for us and the kids.,8
3320,"three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard.",47
3321,and we can afford it!,32
3322,so are we going to buy it?,2
3323,i'm afraid not.,16
3324,"it's too far from your job, isn't it?",36
3325,i can't spend four hours on the road every day.,35
3326,"by the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat.",4

3331,let's turn on the heat.,8
3332,i'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.,35
3333,it should be warmer in a few minutes.,34
3334,it's so nice to have a heated apartment.,52
3335,how did they survive in the old days?,1
3336,they had fireplaces.,34
3337,someone had to chop the wood.,8
3338,and carry it into the house.,34

3344,we never have to call the police about anything.,52
3345,our kids are completely safe.,8
3346,so why are we selling our house?,2
3347,they're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.,37
3348,so we've got to sell before property values go down?,1
3349,yes. i still can't believe our city council allowed this building.,30
3350,that was a huge fire in santa barbara.,52
3351,"yes, it was.",12
3352,they said about 30 houses burned to the ground.,34
3353,and they were expensive houses.,8
3354,i feel so sorry for those people.,10
3355,why feel sorry for rich people?,2
3356,i feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.,0
3357,"so do i, but not if they're rich.",9
3358,what does that have to do with it?,51
3359,rich people think they're better than us.,8
3360,how many rich people do you know?,1
3361,bears are invading our neighborhoods.,34
3362,of course they are. they're starving to death.,8
3363,they should stay in the woods where they belong.,8
3364,there's no food in the woods.,6
3365,can't they eat grass?,51
3366,do you think a bear is a cow?,51
3367,"well, i've seen them eating berries.",19
3368,berries aren't in season all year round.,44
3369,it's too dangerous for kids and pets.,34
3370,people need to cover their trash cans.,34
3371,the police need to shoot all the bears.,34
3372,who did you vote for?,2
3373,i voted for obama.,16
3374,me too.,10
3375,he will be a great president.,34
3376,everyone likes him.,6
3377,he's a good speaker.,34
3378,and he's really smart.,44
3379,he will solve our problems.,6
3380,he will end the war.,8
3381,the next four years will be good years.,34
3382,"i'll vote for him next time, too.",9
3383,the election is next week.,6
3384,who are you voting for?,2
3385,i'm not voting for the mayor.,0
3386,why not?,2
3387,he made promises that he didn't keep.,34
3388,like what?,1
3389,"he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.",12
3390,how many did he hire?,1
3391,one hundred!,21
3392,maybe he had a good reason.,52
3393,maybe he's just a liar.,44
3394,i can't believe he won the election.,0
3395,only 15 percent of the voters turned out.,6
3396,that is a joke.,34
3397,"voting is so important, but people don't bother.",4
3398,many people think their vote doesn't matter.,34
3399,"the mayor won by only 2,000 votes.",4
3400,we're stuck with him for four more years.,8
3401,voting is so easy. you can even mail your ballot in.,34
3402,all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.,52
3403,how easy is that?,7
3404,i guess people just don't care.,0
3405,"well, we have a new president.",42
3406,but we have the same old problems.,34
3407,"well, he's made a few changes.",47
3408,like what?,1
3409,i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.,0
3410,"oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court.",47
3411,who's paying for that?,7
3412,i think we are!,18
3413,"well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.",47
3414,"yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.",47
3415,do any other world leaders have a basketball court?,39
3416,people say that everybody loves obama.,52
3417,"well, more than 50 million people voted for mccain.",42
3418,that's 50 million people who don't love obama.,44
3419,obama's got four years to make everyone happy.,52
3420,he's never going to make everyone happy.,34
3421,can you imagine being president?,7
3422,everyone wants you to solve their problems.,8
3423,i have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.,0
3424,you and everybody else.,8
3425,i would never want to be president.,0
3426,but think about all the power you'd have.,44
3427,did you read this article?,7
3428,what article?,7
3429,it says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.,34
3430,only 11 percent?,2
3431,about 50 percent of the time he's traveling.,34
3432,where does he travel to?,1
3433,"oh, all over the world.",4
3434,but he's supposed to be making our city a better place.,44
3435,he's visiting other cities to get ideas.,8
3436,can't he just go online?,1
3437,the rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.,8
3438,who did you vote for for president?,2
3439,i voted for ralph nader.,16
3440,who in the world is ralph nader?,7
3441,he's the best man for president.,8
3442,why's that?,1
3443,he hates corporations.,34
3444,"well, most corporations do think only about money.",42
3445,he hates democrats and republicans.,52
3446,"well, they do put their party before their country.",4
3447,he's the only candidate that i trust.,35
3448,but he didn't have a chance. nobody voted for him!,37
3449,i don't know why i bother to vote.,10
3450,why's that?,1
3451,what good does it do?,1
3452,you get to put someone in power that you like.,8
3453,only if my candidate wins.,34
3454,"well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him.",42
3455,"but even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.",47
3456,that's true. they promise anything just so they get elected.,8
3457,"and when elected, they go their own way.",42
3458,they forget who put them in power.,6
3459,they forget where they came from.,6
3460,that election for u.s. senator stunk.,54
3461,what do you mean?,7
3462,there were more votes than voters!,32
3463,but that's impossible.,8
3464,officials said that it's possible.,44
3465,did they explain how it's possible?,1
3466,no. they said there are some things you can't explain.,27
3467,so are they going to hold another election?,1
3468,no. that will cost too much money.,54
3469,so it's better to save money than to have an honest election?,13
3470,"well, the democratic party says it was an honest election.",47
3471,i see that former president bush is at a conference.,35
